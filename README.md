# Statistics-BarPlot

# Objective
- The objective of this mission is to create a bar plot for tomato prices in two different years 2014 and 2020, using data from the file "Tomato.csv". 
- The width of each bar should correspond to 10% of the total observations, and the height of each bar should show the relative prevalence measured in the dataset.



## Prerequisites
To complete this mission, you will need:

Python 3 installed on your computer
- A code editor, such as Jupyter Notebook, installed on your computer.
- The "pandas" and "matplotlib" and "numpy" libraries installed in your Python environment
Dataset
- The dataset used for this mission is the "Tomato.csv" file, which contains data on tomato prices in different years. The attributes in the dataset include the date, minimum price, maximum price, and average price of tomatoes.

### Results:
- Maximum average price in 2014: 67.5
- Narrowest price range in 2014: 0.5
- Widest price range in 2014: 18.5
- Maximum average price in 2020: 107.5
- Narrowest price range in 2020: 2.5
- Widest price range in 2020: 40.0
- The average price of tomatoes was higher in 2020 than in 2014
